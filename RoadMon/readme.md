## RoadTrip!

---

The not-so E for everyone story:

The fam is going on a Roadtrip! Can we keep everyone alive? Or at least whoever is driving!? Will we get to pick up Timmy from College?  Will Mom lose all our money? Should we pick up the HitchHiker? Let’s make some badass memories!

---

# Family Trip Rules

1) Stay on the road: Someone must always be awake to drive! If all Pokemon faint, the trip is over.
2) Take turns driving: All mons must stay within 20 levels of one another (Timmy is an exception when you first catch him, but you may not level him up until everyone is within 20 levels).
3) Meds and allergies: You may heal outside of battle as well as in battle. You may not use pure healing moves such as recover, Leech seed, aromatherapy, heal bell, etc. SPORE IS NOW BANNED. Moves such as Giga Drain, Dream Eater are allowed.
4) Shut up! And stay that way: No flutes, shell bell, leftovers or reviving items allowed, all other items are legal. Timmy is CPR certified!? Late in the trip (E4) the fam finds out Timmy isn't a complete bum and is CPR certified! You may use reviving items during the E4 but you may NEVER purchase any. Only those found along the way may be used.
5) Stealing is bad: You may not keep ANY stolen items. (Steal and use mid battle is allowed.)
6) Stopping for snacks: Each family member may buy 1 snack at each shop. You may only enter each shop once so you must buy all your snacks together. You must get your snacks before leaving that town. You may get unlimited repels and poke balls.
7) Refueling: Healing stations are a one time stop. You may not heal via any other healing station unless otherwise stated in another rule.
8) Friends of the family: All TMs and Move Tutors are allowed.
9) The vegan way: You may not intentionally kill a wild Pokemon for EXP. Unless game progression requires you to do so. If a shiny pokemon appears feel free to hunt it.
10) No Redos: You may not re-fight trainers or pickup the same item twice. You may not abuse respawning items (one pickup only).
11) Theme parks: You have only one entry ticket for dungeons. Applies to Caves, Gyms, and Buildings with trainers. All gyms must be full cleared (Mom didn't buy the all-inclusive passes at the good theme parks just to go and skip sh*t).

# The Birds and the Bees

1) Dad : You may choose your starter off of the table, this is “Dad”. Please nickname accordingly. All items, moves, and mons are allowed in the lab. NOTE: Slaking is not impacted by the slow growth rate like legendaries 600 BST+ are, thus making him an excellent Dad!
2) Mum : You must catch 1 Pokemon from Viridian Forest , this is “Mom”. Please nickname accordingly.
3) Kimmy : You must catch 1 pokemon from Route 2 or 22, this is “Kimmy”. Please nickname accordingly.
4) Timmy : You must catch 1 pokemon from Diglett Cave Community College before entering the S.S. Anne, this is “Timmy”. Please nickname accordingly.

# Family Traits

1) Dad : "Gotta fish"
    - You may fish at any of these locations, catch the first encounter and you may keep its held item if it has one. You may also trade any fish if they happen to be part of an in game trade!
    - Locations: Route 6 Pond, Celadon Pond, Route 12 Pier, Fuschia Pond, Cinnabar Pier, Cape Brink (Two Island), Bond Bridge (Three Island), Victory Road Island
2) Mom : "Gotta gamble"
    - On the way out from hideout spend ALL of your money on coins, gamble 10 times.
    - If you come out positive, earnings go towards Game Corner TMs anyone can use. You may also purchase drinks from the Celadon rooftop in addition to your regular snacks! 1  drink each. You may trade these drinks for TMs if you'd like.
    - If you go into the negative, you may not purchase game corner TMs OR purchase yummy drinks on top of the Celadon Mart
    - You must run the game at at least 100% speed for this.
3) Kimmy : "Car Sick"
    - If Kimmy is Poisoned you may not heal the Poison until you reach a Pokemon Center.
    - Additionally, no one in the family can eat (berries, rare candies, etc.) or drink (Fresh Water, Berry Juice, etc.) anything until healing at the next Pokemon Center even if Kimmy faints.
    - **Kimmy may NEVER hold a poison healing item.**
4) Timmy : "Touchy Tummy"
    - So no berries, Milk, Soda, or Candy for this little fella.
5) Family : "Bird Watching"
    - The whole fam loves to look at birds or whatever...you can catch the legendary birds for items and info. Please free them afterwards.
