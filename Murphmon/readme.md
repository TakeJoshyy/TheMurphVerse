2. All items are allowed in the lab.

3. Pivoting:
    - You may catch up to 3 total unique mons from any area (they can be all from one area, all different, or a combination), pick which one you want to run between those 3 and lab mon. You may keep items held by Pokemon.

    - You may receive EXP from 1 wild mon prior to fighting the first trainer but you MUST run the mon that received EXP and avoid receiving additional EXP from wilds at all costs. You may NOT catch any other Pokemon for their items or info after receving EXP from a wild.
    - You may use any Mon at the front of your party until you lock in your pivot. (If a mon dies of poison outside of battle AND you have another Pokemon in your party the run may continue but the poisoned Pokemon is Permadead)
    - You may catch 1 free favorite each. You may catch a second of the same favorite but it will count towards your 3 pivots.

11. You must pivot to a new Pokemon that has not progressed you through the game yet from the Safari Zone (Brock Buddy is eligible for pivoting so long as it was not one of your Mons that progressed you through the game in another capacity). You may catch up to 6 Safari Zone pivot options.
    - Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches **UNLESS** you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once.
