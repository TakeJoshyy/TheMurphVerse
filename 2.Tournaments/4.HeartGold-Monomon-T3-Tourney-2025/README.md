Screenshots are fine, but please take a clip of the encounter and share the link with the screenshot. (This is to ensure encounters are only from livestreamed seeds during the tourney) |

## Rules

Note: PLEASE read, follow, and ask questions about these rules. These are NOT the same rules as Kaizo IronMON despite being heavily inspired by them. With prize pools on the line, we do not take negligence to the rules lightly...if you heck up, ask someone in the discord. (CamMan52 is the final say on penalties).
