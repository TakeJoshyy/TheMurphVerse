|BATTLE PRO - You may equip any one non-consumable held item (Healing items not allowed). You must commit to the item you choose. | VAMPYRIC TOUCH - If you pick up a HP healing non-consumable held item (leftovers, shell bell) you must discard one HP heal that heals less than 50% of your current max HP, if you have one. |
| SHOPAHOLIC - You may purchase one item from any shop once per seed. | NO GUARANTEES - Must have one non 100% accurate in your moveset at earliest availability (cant miss moves count as 100 percent accurate) |
