## Bonus points

|        Bonus Points       |
| :-----------------------: |
| Any Pokemon pair with a combined BST of 900 or lower will accumulate DOUBLE points. If either Pokemon evolves and takes the combined BST over 900, the pair will resume receiving standard points.                |
| Shine on! Whoever encounters the most shinies (excluding Red Gyarados) AND shares in the clips and mons channel in the discord will receive 1 bonus point. Screenshots are fine, but please take a clip of the encounter and share the link with the screenshot. (This is to ensure encounters are only from livestreamed seeds during the tourney) |
| Voltorb Flip Game: Whoever reaches the highest level wins 1 bonus point. 3 Voltorbs blows per run. |
| Pokeathlon - You may compete in the Pokeathlon once per seed AND purchase 1 item with your rewards after. The competitor with the highest score achieved in a single attempt will earn 1 bonus point. |
| Good guess! Guess the PRIMARY typing of the randomized Red Gyarados in a clip and earn 1 bonus point (non-repeatable) |

Tiebreakers - Pokeathlon score, coinflip.

## Rules

Note: PLEASE read, follow, and ask questions about these rules. These are NOT the same rules as Kaizo IronMON despite being heavily inspired by them. With prize pools on the line, we do not take negligence to the rules lightly...if you heck up, ask someone in the discord. (CamMan52 is the final say on penalties).
