# Core Game Rules

You must only use 1 Pokemon for all fights and encounters except double battles unless otherwise denoted.  
I.e. [**“Brawl Buddy” rule.**](#specific-game-rules)

Permadeath: If your primary Pokemon faints, the game is over.

No Shopping: **Except for any type of Pokeball or Repel.**

You can only use items that you pick up, find as a held item on Pokemon or are given by an NPC. NOTE: You may NOT pick berries off of trees.

Select 3 “Favorites” prior to each run. These Pokemon are subject to the 555 BST or under rule.

Stolen Items: You may not keep stolen items from wild pokemon with moves like Thief, Covet, etc.  
**Stealing them from a trainer battle is fine.**

You may not intentionally kill a wild Pokemon for EXP unless game progression requires you to do so, depicted in a specific game rule [(refer to rule 3)](#specific-game-rules) or it is a Shiny Pokemon.

No Redos: You may not re-fight trainers at any point using the VS Seeker or other means (See rule __ for Camera Crew). You may not abuse respawning items by picking them up more than once

No HM Moves on your primary Pokemon.

You can only enter a dungeon once with your primary Pokemon unless the story requires a revisit.
You may not use healing stations in Dungeons. Exceptions: Weather institute after clearing Team Aqua is no longer a dungeon. Route 11 rest house is always allowed.
You must clear (Game progression without leaving to heal) Dungeons before exiting (Beat All Trainers in Gyms clear needed game progress elsewhere).

# Specific Game Rules

1. You may pick any mon you want in the bag that is 555 BST or lower. You may keep its held item. **No legendaries allowed.** If you evolve into a Pokemon that is over 555 BST, you may use that Pokemon so long as it aligns with Ability rules.

2. All items and moves are allowed in the initial wild fight AND rival fight.

3. Pivoting:
    - You may catch up to 3 total unique mons from any area prior to the Aqua Grunt in the forest (they can be all from one area, all different, or a combination), pick which one you want to run between those 3 and bag mon. You may keep items held by these Pokemon. 
    - You must pivot before the Aqua Grunt in the forest. You may fight trainers freely prior to the Aqua Grunt. You may NOT pivot again until the Safari Zone. 
    - You may receive EXP from 1 wild mon prior to fighting the Aqua Grunt but you MUST run the mon that received EXP and avoid receiving additional EXP from wilds at all costs. You may NOT catch any other Pokemon for their items or info after receving EXP from a wild.
    - You may use any Mon at the front of your party until you lock in your pivot. (If a mon dies of poison outside of battle AND you have another Pokemon in your party the run may continue but the poisoned Pokemon is Permadead)
    - You may catch 1 free favorite each. You may catch a second of the same favorite but it will count towards your 3 pivots. 
    - Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches UNLESS you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon). You may catch until you find one without illegal ability (if there is one).

4. "Brawl Buddy": 
    - You may catch a second Pokemon to fight with in the Dewford City Gym only 
    - This must be the first Pokemon you encounter in Dewford Cave. 
    - There are no restrictions[Illegal abilities/BSTs allowed]. 
    - Catch the first encounter or bust. 
    - Brawlbuddy may faint but your primary Pokemon cannot. 
    - You may use Brawlbuddy to lead fights, multiple swaps, or any way you see fit **EXCEPT using illegal moves.**

5. All hidden items are allowed.

6. All found, traded and gifted TMs are allowed (No purchasing TMs) - all move tutors are allowed. - **No HMs.**
    - You may catch one grass Pokemon if you do not have one to obtain TM19 south of Mt. Pyre.
    - You may catch one low base friendship Pokemon to receive TM21 in Pacifidlog.
    - You may only relearn Sketch once from the move relearner.
    - You may use Sketch multiple times if you receive the move in any other capacity.
    - You are allowed to throw balls to scout. BUT, if you accidentally catch a mon while Sketch scouting you must release it and not take its item. You may use flutes so long as they don't impact the battle (i.e. wake up sleep, cure confuse, etc.) to scout moves for Sketch.

8. You must fight Brawley before traveling north of Slateport

9. You may fight the trainers in the Soda Shack but you may NOT obtain the Sodas.

11. You must pivot to a new Pokemon that has not progressed you through the game yet from the Safari Zone (Brawl Buddy is eligible for pivoting so long as it was not one of your Mons that progressed you through the game in another capacity). You may catch up to 6 Safari Zone pivot options.
    - Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches UNLESS you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon). -If you evolve an illegal mon into a legal one with a stone or rare candy that counts as 1 pivot still. You may not level up an illegal mon on trainers.
    - You may catch 1 free pivot of each of your favorites (additional catches count towards your 6 pivot catches).
    - All shinies are free catches
    - You may only level up each Pokemon once before committing to a pivot.
    - You may only get 2 of same mon as an option (Favorites/shinies/illegal mons do not count towards these 2)
    - You may create save states to retry catching encounters or “catch and stow” potential options before committing to them to save time. If you see any of the Pokemon’s stats (including its HP within your party), it automatically counts as one of your catches.

12. You must pivot prior to beating Winona, Lillycove Rival, Maxie in Magma Hideout, and entering Aqua Hideout.

13. You must defeat the Lilycove Rival prior to entering Mt. Pyre.

14. You must bring your pre-Safari pivot into Gym 7 against Tate & Liza. If it somehow dies before the gym leader fight, you can revive it by depositing the pre-Safari pivot in your PC then withdrawing it. You may not use moves or heals during the second mon's turn but there are no restrictions on abilities.

15. Double battles: You may NOT attack with your second Pokemon. All abilities, however, are allowed. You may fight the camera crew once per location. Avoid bringing additional Pokemon into Doubles Battles by forgetting/re-learning HM moves as needed. There should be no need for more than 2 Pokemon in your party at any time.
