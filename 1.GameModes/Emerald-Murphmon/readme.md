Stolen Items: You may not keep stolen items from wild pokemon with moves like Thief, Covet, etc.  
**Stealing them from a trainer battle is fine.**

# Settings

Emerald Murphmon uses its own patch, RNQS file, and Randomizer. Please note that using the Kaizo IronMON settings will NOT work despite heavily inspiring this game mode.

The Murphmon patch includes Quality of life enhancements developed by DrMaple and pathing, movement, and encounter rate changes developed by BigMurph619.

# Specific Game Rules

1. You may pick any mon you want in the bag that is 599 BST or lower. You may keep its held item. **No legendaries allowed.** If you evolve into a Pokemon that is over 599 BST, you may use that Pokemon so long as it aligns with Ability rules.

2. All items, moves, and abilities are allowed through the first rival fight.

3. Pivoting:
    - You may catch up to 3 total unique mons from any area prior to the Aqua Grunt in the forest (they can be all from one area, all different, or a combination), pick which one you want to run between those 3 and bag mon. You may keep items held by these Pokemon. 
    - You must pivot before the Aqua Grunt in the forest. You may fight trainers freely prior to the Aqua Grunt. You may NOT pivot again until the Safari Zone.
    - You may receive EXP from 1 wild mon on each legal pivot option before locking in your runners. If a Pokemon receives exp from a second wild Pokemon, you may NOT run that Pokemon. You may NOT catch a second of that Pokemon as a work around if it is a favorite. Fighting the Aqua Grunt is your cutoff for receiving wild exp.
    - You may use any Mon at the front of your party until you lock in your pivot. (If a mon dies of poison outside of battle AND you have another Pokemon in your party the run may continue but the poisoned Pokemon is Permadead)
    - You may catch 1 free favorite each. You may catch a second of the same favorite but it will count towards your 3 pivots.
    - Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches UNLESS you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon). You may catch until you find one without illegal ability (if there is one).

4. "Brawl Buddy": 
    - You may catch a second Pokemon to fight with in the Dewford City Gym only
    - This must be the first Pokemon you encounter in Dewford Cave.
    - There are no restrictions[Illegal abilities/BSTs allowed].
    - Catch the first encounter or bust.
    - Brawlbuddy may faint but your primary Pokemon cannot.
    - You may use Brawlbuddy to lead fights, multiple swaps, or any way you see fit **EXCEPT using illegal moves.**

5. All hidden items are allowed.

6. All found, traded and gifted TMs are allowed (No purchasing TMs) - all move tutors are allowed. - **No HMs.**
    - You may catch one grass Pokemon if you do not have one to obtain TM19 south of Mt. Pyre.
    - You may catch one low base friendship Pokemon to receive TM21 in Pacifidlog.
    - You may only relearn Sketch once from the move relearner.
    - You may use Sketch multiple times if you receive the move in any other capacity.
    - You are allowed to throw balls to scout. BUT, if you accidentally catch a mon while Sketch scouting you must release it and not take its item. You may use flutes so long as they don't impact the battle (i.e. wake up sleep, cure confuse, etc.) to scout moves for Sketch.

8. You must fight Brawley before traveling north of Slateport

9. You may fight the trainers in the Soda Shack but you may NOT obtain the Sodas.

11. You must pivot to a new Pokemon that has not progressed you through the game yet from the Safari Zone (Brawl Buddy is eligible for pivoting so long as it was not one of your Mons that progressed you through the game in another capacity). You may catch up to 6 Safari Zone pivot options.
    - Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches UNLESS you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon). -If you evolve an illegal mon into a legal one with a stone or rare candy that counts as 1 pivot still. You may not level up an illegal mon on trainers.
    - You may catch 1 free pivot of each of your favorites (additional catches count towards your 6 pivot catches).
    - All shinies are free catches
    - You may only level up each Pokemon once before committing to a pivot.
    - You may only get 2 of same mon as an option (Favorites/shinies/illegal mons do not count towards these 2)
    - You may create save states to retry catching encounters or “catch and stow” potential options before committing to them to save time. If you see any of the Pokemon’s stats (including its HP within your party), it automatically counts as one of your catches.

12. You must pivot prior to beating Winona, Lillycove Rival, Maxie in Magma Hideout, and entering Aqua Hideout.

13. You must defeat the Lilycove Rival prior to entering Mt. Pyre.

14. You must bring your pre-Safari pivot into Gym 7 against Tate & Liza. If it somehow dies before the gym leader fight, you can revive it by depositing the pre-Safari pivot in your PC then withdrawing it. You may not use moves or heals during the second mon's turn but there are no restrictions on abilities.

15. Double battles: You may NOT attack with your second Pokemon. All abilities, however, are allowed. You may fight the camera crew once per location. Avoid bringing additional Pokemon into Doubles Battles by forgetting/re-learning HM moves as needed. There should be no need for more than 2 Pokemon in your party at any time.

16. All held items found on pivot options/HM friend catches are allowed to be kept. "Catch and release" mon held items are not allowed.
    - Purchased/gifted mon's items are not allowed i.e. Weather Institute Castform.
    - You may not catch a wild mon unless it is a pivot option, Shiny, or needed for HM friend.
   
17. You may use the lotto once in hopes of a PP UP

18. Trainer Hill is banned. SS Tidal is allowed.

# NATDEX

NATDEX is a variant of Kaizo IronMON created by cyansixfour that includes all Pokemon and their variants, updated type charts and effectiveness including fairy typing, added in some fairy typing moves, and a few other quality of life changes. NATDEX Murphmon uses the 1.1.2 NATDEX patch with some additional changes to encounter rates in the early game and Safari pivoting for the Murphmon and Monomon formats.

The only rule changes are: You may have 9 favorites instead of 3 and legendaries are allowed as long as they are 599 BST or under.

### Settings and Setup:

This mode utilizes its own patch, tracker extension and randomizer.

The patch utilizes cyansixfour's v1.1.2 patch with some additional changes to encounter rates made by BigMurph619 specifically for Murphmon and Monomon. NOTE: Do NOT use this patch to play NATDEX IronMON as it is catered specifically for this challenge. Download and apply this [patch](https://github.com/TakeJoshyy/TheMurphVerse/blob/main/1.GameModes/Emerald-Monomon/Emerald%20NATDEX%20Murphmon%20and%20monomon%20patch.bps) to your vanilla, legally obtained Emerald ROM.

Utilize the v1.1.2 NatDexExtension and randomizer that can be found [here](https://github.com/CyanSMP64/NatDexExtension/releases/download/v1.1.2/NatDexExtension_v1.1.2.zip)
