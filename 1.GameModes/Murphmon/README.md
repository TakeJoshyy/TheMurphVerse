# What is Murphmon?

### Murphmon is a randomized Pokemon challenge inspired by Super Kaizo IronMON. It aims to be a bit easier and faster while adding more decision making opportunities to the game. Murphmon can be played 10 different ways, all of which remain officially unbeaten. Many rules and settings are mindfully adapted for tournament play and the game is intended to be challenging but beatable.

# Core Game Rules

|You must only use 1 Pokemon for all fights and encounters except where noted in game specific rules.|
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|<div align="center">Permadeath: If your primary Pokemon faints, the game is over. You may not switch Pokemon during battles or encounters unless stated in a game-specific rule. If a switchout is forced, you must immediately switch back in. Your HM friend may be used freely in doubles battles but must follow all battling rules other than the use of HM moves. </div>   |
|<div align="center">You may not use items to heal HP, Status, or PP outside of battle.</div>  |
|<div align="center">You may select as many "favorites" as equal to the generation of game you are playing i.e. 3 for Emerald, 4 for Heartgold, 9 for NATDEX, etc. Favorites must be under 600 BST for all formats besides NATDEX; NATDEX may include 600 BST. Favorites must be selected prior to the start of the attempt. There are no rules against legendaries.</div>  |

## Game Start and Pivoting

|Game Start|
|-|
|<div align="center">In the "Lab" you may chose your starter and use any items and moves available to you. The "Lab" is defined as the entire game through the first rival fight. After rival fight, standard rules apply.</div>  |
|<div align="center">You must select a Pokemon under 600 BST unless you are playing the NATDEX variant of the game. All "pivot" options are subject to this BST as well.</div>  |
|<div align="center">You may catch 3 UNIQUE pivot options from the areas prior to the lock-in point. You may keep the items held by these Pokemon.</div>  |
|<div align="center">Pivoting is dynamic, meaning you may run any Pokemon at the front of your party during the pivoting phase. As long the Pokemon in the front of your party lives, the run may continue (a Pokemon that dies to overworld poison damage may no longer be used -- but it must not be in the front of your party).</div>  |
|<div align="center">Evolving into a Pokemon over the BST limit is ok. Additionally, evolving into a Pokemon with an illegal ability warrants an additional pivot if it happens before the lockin point. If evo occurs after the lock-in point, it is COMPLETELY legal to be ran with no restrictions.</div>  |
|<div align="center">You may get 1 of each favorite as a free catch (selecting it in the lab awards 1 additional pivot option). Additionally, selecting a Pokemon with an illegal ability awards 1 additional pivot option.</div>  |
|<div align="center">Pokemon may only receive EXP from a wild once prior to the early game lock in point or from required game progression encounters. Receiving EXP from a wild after the "Lock in" point should be avoided at all costs. Receiving EXP from a second wild Pokemon prior to the "Lock in" point disqualifies it from being ran and must be deposited ASAP. All shinies are free catches or kills and do not count towards EXP or catch rules.</div>  |
|<div align="center">"Catch and release" is allowed ONLY for unescapable situations such as Block. Moves such as Fire Spin that are temporary do not warrant catch and release. You may catch, then release the Pokemon without looking at any information to prevent it from counting as a pivot option.</div>  |
|<div align="center">You may run one of your pivot options or your starter.</div>  |
|<div align="center">Once you settle on a pivot, you must run it until you reach the mid game pivot point (i.e. Safari Zone).</div>  |

---

|Mid Game Pivot|
|-|
|<div align="center">You must pivot to a new Pokemon under 600 BST (Under 601 for NATDEX) that has not progressed you through the game yet (starters and Pokemon that passed the lock-in point) from the Mid Game pivoting area. See game specific rules for additional details on when/where this pivot must happen. These will be referred to as "Safari Pivots" going forward.</div>  |
|<div align="center">You must complete the remainder of the game with your Safari Pivot.</div>  |
|<div align="center">You may catch up to 6 Safari Options. You may catch 1 free pivot of each of your favorites (additional catches count towards your 6 pivot catches). All shinies are free catches.</div>  |
|<div align="center">Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches **UNLESS** you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon). -If you evolve an illegal mon into a legal one with a stone or rare candy that counts as 1 pivot still. You may not level up an illegal mon on trainers.</div>  |
|<div align="center">You may only get 2 of same mon as an option (Favorites/shinies/illegal mons do not count towards these 2).</div>  |
|<div align="center">Leveling up a pivot option 2 levels locks it in as your Safari Pivot.</div>  |
|<div align="center">Seeing a Pokemon's HP stat confirms it as a Safari Option.</div>  |
|<div align="center">You may check TMs, move tutors, etc. on a Safari Option BUT bringing a Safari Option anywhere in your party into a dungeon counts as your re-visit. (Don't soft lock yourself in Silph Co.).</div>  |

# Game-Specific Rules

## NATDEX

NATDEX is a variant of Kaizo IronMON created by cyansixfour that includes all Pokemon and their variants, updated type charts and effectiveness including fairy typing, added in some fairy typing moves, and a few other quality of life changes. NATDEX Murphmon uses the 1.1.2 NATDEX patch with some additional changes to encounter rates in the early game and Safari pivoting for the Murphmon and Monomon formats.

The only rule changes are: You may have 9 favorites instead of 3 and the BST limit is allowed up to 600 BST.
