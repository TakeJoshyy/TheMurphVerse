# Core Game Rules:

`There is no “Brockbuddy” in this mode.`

Permadeath: If your primary Pokemon faints, the game is over.

No Shopping: **Except for any type of Pokeball or Repel.**

You can only use items that you pick up, find as a held item on Pokemon or are given by an NPC, no use of stores.

Select 3 “Favorites” prior to each run. These Pokemon are subject to the 555 BST or under rule.

Stolen Items: You may not keep stolen items from wild pokemon with moves like Thief, Covet, etc.  
**Stealing them from a trainer battle is fine.**

You may not intentionally kill a wild Pokemon for EXP unless game progression requires you to do so, depicted in a specific game rule [(refer to rule 3)](#specific-game-rules) or it is a Shiny Pokemon.

No Redos: You may not re-fight trainers at any point using the VS Seeker or other means. You may not abuse respawning items by picking them up more than once

No HM Moves on your primary Pokemon. You may use HM moves during double battles with your second Pokemon.

You can only enter a dungeon once with your primary Pokemon unless the story requires a revisit.
You may not use healing stations in Dungeons.

# Settings

Firered Monomon uses its own patch, RNQS file, and Randomizer. Please note that using the Super Kaizo IronMON settings will NOT work despite heavily inspiring this game mode.

The Monomon patch includes Quality of life enhancements developed by DrMaple and encounter rate/Safari Fishing changes developed by BigMurph619.

Download and apply Firered Murphmon/Monomon patch to your vanilla, legally obtained Firered ROM [Patch](https://github.com/TakeJoshyy/TheMurphVerse/blob/main/1.GameModes/Murphmon/Firered%20Murphmon%20and%20Monomon%20Patch.ips)

# Specific Game Rules

1. You may pick any mon you want in the lab that is 555 BST or lower. You may keep its held item. **No legendaries allowed.** If you evolve into a Pokemon that is over 555 BST, you may use that Pokemon so long as it aligns with Ability rules.

2. All items, moves, and abilities are allowed in the lab.

3. Pivoting: 
    - You may catch up to 3 total unique mons from any area (they can be all from one area, all different, or a combination), pick which one you want to run between those 3 and lab mon. You may keep items held by Pokemon. 
    - You must pivot before the first trainer fight after the lab. You may NOT pivot again after fighting the first trainer.
    - You may receive EXP from 1 wild mon prior to fighting the first trainer but you MUST run the mon that received EXP and avoid receiving additional EXP from wilds at all costs. You may NOT catch any other Pokemon for their items or info after receving EXP from a wild.
    - You may use any Mon at the front of your party until you lock in your pivot. (If a mon dies of poison outside of battle AND you have another Pokemon in your party the run may continue but the poisoned Pokemon is Permadead)
    - You may catch 1 free favorite each. You may catch a second of the same favorite but it will count towards your 3 pivots. 
    - Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches UNLESS you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon).

4. All hidden items are allowed. You may only obtain step items once each.

5. All found, Traded and gifted TMs are allowed (No purchasing TMs) - all move tutors are allowed (i.e. mega punch/kick guys after mt. Moon). **No HMs.** 
    - You may only relearn Sketch once from the move relearner. 
    - You may use Sketch multiple times if you receive the move in any other capacity. 
    - Please note that there are 100% catch rates in Monomon, so throwing balls will not work to scout moves. You may use flutes so long as they don't impact the battle (i.e. wake up sleep, cure confuse, etc.) to scout moves for Sketch.

6. You must beat Misty before “Dig” Rocket.

7. You must beat Lt. Surge before entering Rock Tunnel.

8. SS Anne EXP and item farming is allowed (Treat this as a dungeon).

9. You must beat Erika before tower.

10. You must beat the Dojo before entering Silph Co.

11. You must beat Sabrina before entering the Pokemon Mansion.

12. Sevii islands are treated as "overworld". All items allowed, all exp allowed, etc. 
    - You may return to Sevii islands at any point. 
    - You may use a second HM friend for Rock Smash as needed.

13. Double battles: 
    - You may use any legal second mon you have already caught. 
    - You may attack freely with the second mon and it may hold legal held items. 
    - You may only have 2 Pokemon in your party.

14. All held items found on pivot options/HM friend catches are allowed to be kept. "Catch and release" mon held items are not allowed. 
    - Purchased/gifted mon's items are not allowed i.e. Magikarp Route 4, Silph Co. Lapras, Dojo Hitmon. 
    - You may not catch a wild mon unless it is a pivot option, Shiny, or needed for HM friend.
