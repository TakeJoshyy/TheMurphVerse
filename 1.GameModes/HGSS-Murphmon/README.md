# Specific Game Rules

|Notes|
|-|
|The Murphmon settings string eliminates "bad berries".|
|You are allowed to change to game's time for events that occur on specific days within the game or to change weather for the Red fight.|
|You may only keep items obtained from Rock Smash if it is the first smash.|
|You cannot defeat the Shiny Gyarados more than once. (respawns after E4) |
|You may return to fight trainers in any building with your Bug Catching Pivot. (One round of fighting for pre-pivot and 1 for post pivot for the lighthouse) |
|You may use Flash freely. |
|Each building of the Radio Tower story sequence is treated separately. You can heal as you go from the tower to the basement, or basement back to the tower. You can fight trainers in the tower when you return later to finish the story. |
|Double battles: You may use your HM friend freely in Doubles Fights. |

1. You may pick any mon you want in the lab that is 599 BST or lower except Mythicals and Legendaries. You may keep its held item. If you evolve into a Pokemon that is over 599 BST, you may use that Pokemon so long as it aligns with Ability rules.

2. All items, moves, and abilities are allowed through the first rival fight.

3. Pivoting:
    - You may catch up to 3 total unique mons from any area prior to Bellsprout Tower (they can be all from one area, all different, or a combination), pick which one you want to run between those 3 and bag mon. You may keep items held by these Pokemon. 
    - You must choose your pivot before entering Bellsprout Tower and Falkner's Gym. You may fight trainers freely prior. Once receiving exp from a wild Pokemon or entering Bellsprout Tower or Falkner's gym, you are locked in.
    - You may receive EXP from 1 wild mon prior to entering Bellsprout Tower but you MUST run the mon that received EXP and avoid receiving additional EXP from wilds at all costs. You may NOT catch any other Pokemon for their items or info after receving EXP from a wild.
    - You may use any Mon at the front of your party until you lock in your pivot.
    - You may catch 1 free favorite each. You may catch a second of the same favorite but it will count towards your 3 pivots. Getting a favorite in the lab grants you a 4th pivot option.
    - Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches UNLESS you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon). You may catch until you find one without illegal ability (if there is one).

4. All found, traded and gifted TMs are allowed (No purchasing TMs) - all move tutors are allowed. - **No HMs.**
    - You may only relearn Sketch once from the move relearner.
    - You may use Sketch multiple times if you receive the move in any other capacity.
    - Please note that there are 100% catch rates in Monomon, so throwing balls will not work to scout moves. You may use flutes so long as they don't impact the battle (i.e. wake up sleep, cure confuse, etc.) to scout moves for Sketch.
  
5. BugsyBuddy Rule - You may bring 1 "Buddy" with you into Bugsy's gym. You may use this buddy freely to help you defeat the gym. The BugsyBuddy MUST be the first Pokemon you encounter in the patch of grass East of Azalea Town. If you fail to catch this Buddy, you may bring a second mon into the gym (it is needed for the doubles fight) but you may not use it for any advantage in non doubles fights (i.e. swapping in to heal).

6. Bug Catching Contest Pivot:
  -You must pivot after defeating Morty and before fighting Chuck.
  -The pivot must be done in one of the Bug Catching Contest areas, which are available on Tues/Thurs/Sat
  -There are no level restrictions on pivot options.
  -The Super Kaizo patch includes a Celebi to adjust times for Bug Catching Contest

Murphmon Pivoting: You must pivot to a new Pokemon that has not progressed you through the game yet from the Bug Catching Contest (BugsyBuddy is eligible for pivoting so long as it was not one of your Mons that progressed you through the game in another capacity). You may catch up to 6 Bug Catching Contest pivot options.
    - Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches **UNLESS** you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon). If you evolve an illegal mon into a legal one with a stone or rare candy that counts as 1 pivot still. You may not level up an illegal mon on trainers.
    - You may catch 1 free pivot of each of your favorites (additional catches count towards your 6 pivot catches).
    - All shinies are free catches
    - You may only level up each Pokemon once before committing to a pivot.
    - You may only get 2 of same mon as an option (Favorites/shinies/illegal mons do not count towards these 2)
    -You may create save states to retry catching encounters or “catch and stow” potential options before committing to them to save time. If you see any of the Pokemon’s stats (including its HP within your party), it automatically counts as one of your catches.

7. You must defeat Chuck and the rest of the game with your Bug Catching Contest pivot.

8. You must defeat Chuck and Jasmine prior to entering Mahogany Town.

9. Kanto is free game (no mandatory pathing or dungeons) other than you must defeat all trainers in Gyms before leaving to heal.

10. You must defeat Red to beat Murphmon. ALL moves (except HMs), held items, X items, etc. are allowed for this fight.

Good luck Challenger.
