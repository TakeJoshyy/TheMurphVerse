# Core Game Rules

You must only use 1 Pokemon for all fights and encounters except double battles unless otherwise denoted.  
NOTE: There is no "BugsyBuddy rule" in this mode.

Permadeath: If your primary Pokemon faints, the game is over.

No Shopping: **Except for any type of Pokeball or Repel.**

All hidden items are allowed to be picked up. You can only use items that you pick up, find as a held item on Pokemon or are given by an NPC. NOTE: You may NOT pick berries off of trees.

Select 4 “Favorites” prior to each run. These Pokemon are subject to the 599 BST or under rule.

Stolen Items: You may not keep stolen items from wild pokemon with moves like Thief, Covet, etc.  
**Stealing them from a trainer battle is fine.**

You may not intentionally kill a wild Pokemon for EXP unless game progression requires you to do so, depicted in a specific game rule [(refer to rule 3)](#specific-game-rules) or it is a Shiny Pokemon. You may catch and release if you are trapped via an opponent move such as Fire Spin.

No Redos: You may not re-fight trainers at any point using the VS Seeker or other means. You may not abuse respawning items by picking them up more than once.

No HM Moves on your primary Pokemon.

You can only enter a dungeon once with your primary Pokemon unless the story requires a revisit.
You may not use healing stations in Dungeons.
You must clear (Game progression without leaving to heal) Dungeons before exiting (Beat All Trainers in Gyms clear needed game progress elsewhere).

    - Purchased/gifted mon's items are not allowed.

# Specific Game Rules

|Notes|
|-|
|The Monomon settings string eliminates "bad berries".|
|You are allowed to change to game's time for events that occur on specific days within the game or to change weather for the Red fight.|
|You may only keep items obtained from Rock Smash if it is the first smash.|
|You cannot defeat the Shiny Gyarados more than once. (respawns after E4) |
|You may only fight trainers on your first visit to the lighthouse (you must speak to Jasmine or you will be soft locked). |
|You may use Flash freely. |
|Each building of the Radio Tower story sequence is treated separately. You can heal as you go from the tower to the basement, or basement back to the tower. You can fight trainers in the tower when you return later to finish the story. |
|Double battles: You may use your HM friend freely in Doubles Fights |

1. You may pick any mon you want in the lab that is 599 BST or lower except Mythicals and Legendaries. You may keep its held item. If you evolve into a Pokemon that is over 599 BST, you may use that Pokemon so long as it aligns with Ability rules.

2. All items, moves, and abilities are allowed through the first rival fight.

3. Pivoting:
    - You may catch up to 3 total unique mons from any area prior to Bellsprout Tower (they can be all from one area, all different, or a combination), pick which one you want to run between those 3 and bag mon. You may keep items held by these Pokemon. 
    - You must choose your pivot before entering Bellsprout Tower and Falkner's Gym. You may fight trainers freely prior. Once receiving exp from a wild Pokemon or entering Bellsprout Tower or Falkner's gym, you are locked in.
    - You may receive EXP from 1 wild mon prior to entering Bellsprout Tower but you MUST run the mon that received EXP and avoid receiving additional EXP from wilds at all costs. You may NOT catch any other Pokemon for their items or info after receving EXP from a wild.
    - You may use any Mon at the front of your party until you lock in your pivot.
    - You may catch 1 free favorite each. You may catch a second of the same favorite but it will count towards your 3 pivots. Getting a favorite in the lab grants you a 4th pivot option.
    - Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches UNLESS you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon). You may catch until you find one without illegal ability (if there is one).

4. All found, traded and gifted TMs are allowed (No purchasing TMs) - all move tutors are allowed. - **No HMs.**
    - You may only relearn Sketch once from the move relearner.
    - You may use Sketch multiple times if you receive the move in any other capacity.
    - Please note that there are 100% catch rates in Monomon, so throwing balls will not work to scout moves. You may use flutes so long as they don't impact the battle (i.e. wake up sleep, cure confuse, etc.) to scout moves for Sketch.

5. You must defeat Chuck and Jasmine prior to entering Mahogany Town.

6. Kanto is free game (no mandatory pathing or dungeons) other than you must defeat all trainers in Gyms before leaving to heal.

7. You must defeat Red to beat Monomon. ALL moves (except HMs), held items, X items, etc. are allowed for this fight.

Good luck Challenger.
