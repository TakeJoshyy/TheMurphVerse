| Jackpot Baby! If you are able to obtain a JACKPOT in 10 spins or less at the Celadon Game Corner, you will receive 1 bonus point! You may attempt 10 spins every seed you make it to the game corner. You MUST attempt the slots at 100% game speed and have a clip for proof! |
| Its better to be lucky than good! In the route 4 Pokemon Center, you are given a "Magikarp" for 500 poke dollars. Whoever receives the Pokemon with the HIGHEST BST will receive 1 bonus point! Please confirm with a screenshot sent to the discord channel "Clips and mons". In the case of a tie, all challengers tied with the highest BST "Magikarp" will receive the bonus point. |
